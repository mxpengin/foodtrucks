It's main characteristics are:

- The website is a vanilla react app
- The information is retrieved from the user's web browser from https://data.sfgov.org/resource/rqzj-sfat.json
- The list contains the geo-localization of each truck, and this is used to display them over an embedded google map layer.
- The list contains the type of food that is served, and this is used for a simple classification based on regex.
- The list contains the name of the business that is displayed over each location when the mouse is passed over each one.
